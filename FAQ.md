## Frequently Asked Questions

- Can I use this plugin to authenticate a third-party app that doesn't rely on local folders?

    No. That's not the purpose of this plugin. There are many extensions and libraries to share authentication between different platforms.

- Must the third-party app be part of the same website?

    Yes, the plugin relies on same-site cookies.

- Can I install WordPress in a subfolder and still let it manage the main website?

    Yes, WordPress can be installed in a subfolder and still handle the site as if it was in the root folder. See WordPress documentation for details.
